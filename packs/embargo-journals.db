They push their way through stacks of iron sheets and barrels, walking towards the ﬂickering lights at the end of the hall. They are greeted by a shrill, distorted “Wel-come!” recognizably from a Vocoder before they can make out any  more details.</p>\n<p>The skeleton of a shipping container hangs on a bunch of steel cables over a pitch black hole. The side that the characters approach has been cut out roughly 1 m above the ground and replaced by bars with a hatch.</p>\n<p>Inside, there is cold light.

The characters can step up and show the ar-tifact that Token has prepared. The Chronicler opens the hatch, leans out, takes the artifact, carries it to the work-bench, puts it there. Cascades of light blink across the side of the analysis station; a yellow light ﬂares and pulses.</p>\n<p>With two long strides, the Chronicler returns to the characters, crouches out of sight for a moment, and re-turns with a handful of Chronicler Drafts.</p>\n<p>The artifact crackles and ticks. The Chronicler turns around and says in a high, female voice, “What the…” Then, a ﬂash of light tears apart the artifact and the work-bench. The bang makes the bars shake and the container ring like a gong. The Chronicler crashes against the bars and falls to the ground, feedback through their Vocod-er rises to a screeching crescendo. Red lights ﬂash in the container, and it races downwards. At the other end of the hall, the gates start to close, the rectangle of light be-coming smaller and smaller. The characters can start run-ning, but they are not fast enough: the gate crashes closed. Darkness surrounds the characters.</p>\n<p> The characters have walked into Blacksmith’s trap.

As if this weren’t bad enough, the characters are living in constant fear of a Gendo attack. So far, the pack has been careful, but as soon as it looks like it’s going to lose its prey, it will attack.</p>\n<h2>LOOKOUT: THE EXIT</h2>\n<p>If the characters search the walls, they discover a staircase high above along one side of the hall, leading higher and higher into the cave along the wall and ﬁnally ending in a door. The ascent has to start somewhere at the other end of the hall.</p>\n<h2>THIS WAY</h2>\n<p>Huge white letters on the containers say things like “this way,” with arrows pointing the way right next to the words. If the characters don’t trust the ﬁrst “this way” and choose another way, they walk into a trap. A little more than 20 paces ahead, they see the Chronicler from before. Without his mask, he’s recognizable as a woman: it’s Giada. She presses something to her chest, and a yellow light gleams between her ﬁngers. If the characters approach, she presses a button, drops the object, and runs.</p>\n<p>On the container next to the characters, the Black-smith has collected scrap. Over a cable control, a weight smashes into this cliﬀ of scrap—and collapses it. It rushes down on the characters as an avalanche: with a successful <strong>BOD+Athletics (3) </strong>or <strong>AGI+Mobility (3)</strong> roll, both in combi-nation with <strong>PSY+Reaction (3)</strong>, a character can dodge.

{"name":"(S) 14. The bridge","content":"<h1>THE BRIDGE</h1>\n<p>The closer the characters approach the center of the hall, the more containers there are.</p>\n<p>Their way is blocked. Here, the bridge crane spans the hall. Its engine and track bearing are embedded high up in the wall of the hall. The torchlight shows that loading units are attached to the brace: centuries ago, the crane was able to lift several containers at once and carry them through the hall. Today, 10 containers are still hanging from the grippers, like a giant wind chime. Seven of them are way out of reach but the three low-hanging ones form a mounting bridge in front of the wall of containers. They are interlinked with iron sheets and moored with steel ropes. To the lower left is an entrance via scaﬀolding made of scrap, and to the upper right, the bridge ends at the top of the wall of containers.</p>\n<p>As soon as the characters begin climbing, the Blacksmith’s voice drones from speakers, “So you want your old den back. Want to cover your tracks. I’ll send you your friend.”</p>\n<p>Again, the characters see Giada in front of them. She rushes across the planks of a bridge; her steps make the containers swing gently. Reaching the top, she drags forth someone, pushing the person ahead of her.</p>\n<p>As the person moves towards the characters along the guiding rope, it keeps getting faster. The person’s feet keep hitting the sheets uncontrollably, the arms pressed tightly against the body.</p>\n<p>The cowl billows and ﬂies in the headwind.</p>\n<p>From below, the Gendos follow as they see their prey disappear.</p>\n<p>There is almost no room to dodge the oncoming person on the rail bridges, and the front character on the containers must make an Action roll on AGI+Mobility (4) to do so. If he steps aside, the character behind him can be hit. But he may roll as well, just like all other characters.</p>\n<p>If the person hits a character, he’s thrown from the bridge and falls for 3 to 4 m. However, the fact that the Gendos attack at as soon as they hit the ground is certainly worse than the fall itself.</p>\n<p>If the whole group dodges, the human projectile hits the ﬁrst Gendo, throwing it down to the hall. With a broken neck, the animal lies on the ﬂoor howling.</p>\n<p>The person’s cowl ﬂies free from the face as the human projectile loses the cape it’s wearing.
