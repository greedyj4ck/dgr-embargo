Picked clean like chicken bones. But the Scrapper Cave Bear Blacksmith knew how to pick &rsquo;em. Most of the runes were unknown to him, but how could that be? Someone had gone to great lengths to mark the ruins as dead with faulty runes. So he went and combed through the parts covered with the forged runes. Successfully. After only a few days, he discovered a massive artifact that had not even rusted. Nearby, he had seen a Chronicler next to a hall, so he dragged his loot there. Blacksmith got a couple of Drafts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Back in Justitian, he celebrated for a week. When he showed up in Tech Central a month later with new findings, the Chroniclers suddenly threw him out of the Alcove. He got no access to the Chronicler network, and a &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; sign showing his face hung at every node next to Chronicler killers and other outlaws. Why?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He retreated to the wasteland. He shouted out his fury, considered what had happened without finding a solution. He raged through the ruins, smashing walls and ancient tables with his axe, blindly laying about. Worn out, he retreated deeper into the ruins, huddled into his den, and brooded. What was wrong? It had started when he wasted the Drafts he had gotten for his last finding&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He made no progress. So he bundled up his furs, shouldered his axe, and went to a badly protected Alcove at the fringes of the Protectorate. It couldn&rsquo;t get any worse, he thought, kicking in the door and throwing the Chronicler down on his workbench. He found the reason for what had happened: he was alleged to have forged and circulated Drafts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bullshit. Someone had slipped them to him. And he knew who. A whole season had passed, but the Blacksmith never hesitated at a fork in the road. He walked across fields of ruins and took old smuggler paths until he saw the Tumbler, went past it, and finally found the Alcove that had paid him a fortune for his last big finding. This was the starting point, the worm in the apple. Again, the Blacksmith stood in front of the warehouse and thought: it can&rsquo;t get any worse.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Blacksmith background\" href=\"https://degenesis.com/world/bio/scrappers/blacksmith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(website source www.degenesis.com)</a></p>","gmnotes":"","groupname":"","alignment":"","constellation":"","scarsValue":""},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Blacksmith","displayName":0,"actorLink":true,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":0,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"light":{"dim":0,"bright":0,"angle":360,"color":null,"alpha":0.25,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"coloration":1,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"texture":{"src":"modules/dgr-embargo/assets/tokens/gold/BLACKSMITH.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"visionMode":"basic"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"degenesis","systemVersion":"0.5.0","coreVersion":"10.277","createdTime":1659818781234,"modifiedTime":1659818781234,"lastModifiedBy":"D3a0dV7Jz1rj0DtC"},"_id":"cL5Gp6js3T3G6FHv","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"D3a0dV7Jz1rj0DtC":3}}
